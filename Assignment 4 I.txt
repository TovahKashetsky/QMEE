Assignment 4 I – MMV A person with one positive test result has a 1 in 6 chance of actually having MMD (5% false positives + 1% true positives). I would tell them to get tested again. If their second test is also positive, they have MMD. If their second test is negative, get tested a third time. If that third test is negative, they don’t have MMD, and if it's positive, then they do have MMD.
