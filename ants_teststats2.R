## JD: Your script should print your plots (and other things that are results and not just sanity checks)
## If it were me, I might _just_ print them (you can assign them to names later if you want to build on them). But this was the quickest way for me to see what you did.

print(plotdecision)
print(plotdark)
print(plotcohesion)
print(plotdark2)

## Nice exploration; I'm surprised you didn't find something you liked with points and markers both. We could ask Ben about thatâ€¦ maybe just plot medians and points
