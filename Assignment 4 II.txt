Assignment 4 II - Data HypothesesI think I will run three models for the two phases of my experiment.Training phase: Looking at change over time within each group because we cannot directly compare groups (the measures are different, even though the IV for both is called decision latency), so run two different models.Model 1: Choice group performance over the training phase.Independent variable = time events (6 training sessions)Dependent variable 1 = decision latencyDependent variable 2 = proportion of transports to better nestHypothesis: decision latency decreases with time, and prop transports increase with time.Stats: A linear mixed-effects model could work.Model 2: No Choice group performance over the training phase.Independent variable = time events (6 training sessions)Dependent variable = decision latencyHypothesis: decision latency decreases with time.Stats: A linear mixed effects-model could work.Test: Looking at difference between groups for a single time event (directly comparable).Model 3: Choice group and No Choice group performance on the test.Independent variable = experience with or without decision-making (choice and no choice groups)Dependent variable 1 = decision latencyDependent variable 2 = proportion of transports to better nestHypothesis: the choice group will have shorter decision latency and a larger proportion of transports to the better nest than the no choice group.Stats: A MANOVA could work.
