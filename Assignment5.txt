Hypothesis 1: Colonies will gradually improve performance (by increasing speed and efficiency) as they gain experience with decision-making.Test 1: linear mixed-effects model where I permutate decision speed or efficiency at the time events (6 training sessions) to test if experience increases performance. Null = performance is not different across time events. Test 2: (exploratory) simple regression to test if experience with decision-making increases cohesion. Null = cohesion is not different across time events. [Background details: during the training phase, colonies emigrate with either 2 nest options (choice group) or one nest option (no choice group). Colonies in the choice group can split into both nests.]Test 3: (exploratory) simple regression to test if experience with emigrating increases overall speed. Null = speed is not different across time events. [Background details: IÕll measure the median transport time to present overall transport time. I use the median transport instead of last transport to avoid relying on outliers.]Hypothesis 2: Colonies with experience making collective decisions will perform better (by increasing decision speed and increasing efficiency) on a decision-making task than colonies without experience decision-making.Test 1: T-test where I permutate decision speed or efficiency (one at a time) to test if experience improves performance. Null = choice and no choice groups do not differ in decision speed or efficiency. Test 2: PERMANOVA where I permutate decision speed and efficiency to test if experience improves performance. Null = choice and no choice groups do not differ in decision speed or efficiency.
