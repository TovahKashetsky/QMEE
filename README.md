About my data: I want to know if social groups improve their collective decision-making as they gain experience. To do this, I am providing 20 ant colonies (choice group) with experience making a choice between a good- and poor-quality nest during emigration, and 20 colonies (no choice group) with a single nest during emigration, leaving no room for decision-making. After six emigrations during the training phase, I challenged all colonies to decide between two nest options during a final test emigration. I predict that the choice group with be faster and more efficient at decision-making than the no choice group. I also predict both groups will improve performance throughout the training phase.
