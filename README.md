# Assignment 1 #

About my data: I want to know if social groups improve their collective decision-making as they gain experience. To do this, I am providing 20 ant colonies (choice group) with experience making a choice between a good- and poor-quality nest during emigration, and 20 colonies (no choice group) with a single nest during emigration, leaving no room for decision-making. After six emigrations during the training phase, I challenged all colonies to decide between two nest options during a final test emigration. I predict that the choice group with be faster and more efficient at decision-making than the no choice group. I also predict both groups will improve performance throughout the training phase.

# Assignment 2 #

This is only a small portion of my data so far, I will be getting more soon. I want to look at changes in my variables over time (training sessions). I also want to compare the variables in the final session (will add it as training 7) between the choice group and no choice group. I run 10 colonies at a time, 5 of each group, so each ten is considered a replicate.

# Assignment 3 #

With the test data from my experiment (different that what I used in assignment 1 and 2), I wanted to compare three variables between my two groups to show the differences. 
After trying out some different types (violin, jitter, scatter, dotplot) I found the boxplot best represented what I wanted, and the range and quartiles are informative. Geom_point was also nice to see individual data points, but I liked seeing the median in the boxplots. Combining the geom_point and boxplot didn't look good either. I omitted most of the trial and error in the script to clean it up.
The Cleveland hierarchy: My three variables are measured in different units so I kept the plots separate. I think I followed the rules well, it's not very hard with a simple boxplot. Except that I have colour because it looks nicer than plain bars, although without colour the plots would give the same info.

# Assignment 4 #

MMV question: A person with one positive test result has a 1 in 6 chance of actually having MMD (5% false positives + 1% true positives). I would tell them to get tested again. If their second test is also positive, they have MMD. If their second test is negative, get tested a third time. If that third test is negative, they donâ€™t have MMD, and if its positive, then they do have MMD.

Data hypotheses: I think I would run three models for the two phases of my experiment.

Training phase: Looking at change over time within each group because we cannot directly compare groups (the measures are different, even though the IV for both is called decision latency), so run two different models.

Model 1: Choice group performance over the training phase.
Independent variable = time events (6 training sessions),
Dependent variable 1 = decision latency,
Dependent variable 2 = proportion of transports to better nest. 
Hypothesis: decision latency decreases with time, and prop transports increase with time.
Stats: A linear mixed-effects model could work.

Model 2: No Choice group perfomarmance over the training phase.
Independent variable = time events (6 training sessions),
Dependent variable = decision latency,
Hypothesis: decision latency decreases with time.
Stats: A linear mixed effects-model could work.

Test: Looking at difference between groups for a single time event (directly comparable).
Model 3: Choice group and No Choice group performance on the test.
Independent variable = experience with or without decision-making (choice and no choice groups),
Dependent variable 1 = decision latency,
Dependent variable 2 = proportion of transports to better nest. 
Hypothesis: the choice group will have shorter decision latency and a larger proportion of transports to the better nest than the no choice group.
Stats: A MANOVA could work.
